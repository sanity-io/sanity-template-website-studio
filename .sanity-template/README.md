# A website studio

This is a studio-only starter for a website backend that you can bring your own frontend to.

**Features:**

- WordPress-esque content models (but better)
- Types for pages, posts, routes, navigation, comments
- Split-pane view for viewing post comments (using incoming references)
- Deploys on Netlify

If you want to launch this project to try out the studio, go to [sanity.io/create](https://sanity.io/create?template=sanity-io/sanity-template-website-studio).
